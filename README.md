The `data-depression-psyctr` dataset is part of the meta-analytic research domain ([MARD](https://docs.metapsy.org/uploads/ebmental-2022-300509.pdf)) on psychotherapy for depression. This MARD is part of the [Metapsy project](https://www.metapsy.org/). The dataset contains study information and effect size data of trials on psychotherapy for adult depression. The date of the last search update is provided [here](https://github.com/metapsy-project/data-depression-psyctr/blob/main/metadata/last_search.txt). 

This dataset includes psychotherapy vs. control (`psy vs ctr`) comparisons. Effect sizes are provided for depression outcomes at post-test. It includes one type of effect size calculation per study, giving priority to means and standard deviations at post-test, followed by change scores, binary outcomes, and other statistics.

The dataset follows the [Metapsy data standard](https://docs.metapsy.org/data-preparation/format/).
